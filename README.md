# To-Do Application

This website is a place where individual users can log in and write down tasks that they need to complete. Once they finish, they can cross them off or delete them.
Accounts are protected, making this website a great fit for you!

You can even use this from anywhere since this is based on you logging into the website and signing up.

## Features
